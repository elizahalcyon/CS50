If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener.
What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

The average energy for the playlist is .65906 and the danceability average is .71746. These suggest that the listener of this playlist prefers
high energy, upbeat music that makes them want to move. However, the valence is only at .484443, indicating the songs theme of the songs aren't
as upbeat as the energy level. I would characterize the aura as Purple: "This aura color pairs well with passionate music listeners. Purple
auras tune in to get amped up, entertained, and moving while they navigate the twists and turns of their day."

Rather than looking at the mean, I would suggest looking at the median. A few outliers can too easily skew the data. Perhaps rounding the values
to the near whole number or tenth, then finding the mode.
