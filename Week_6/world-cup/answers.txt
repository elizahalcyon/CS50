Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: I expected some small changes between different rounds,
but was surprised that 10,000 had more differences than the others. 

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
At least 10,000, because the previous iterations didn't even include all the teams. One million is far too expensive and unnecessary.
Although 10,000 had several different results than the others, which I don't know if that makes it more or less accurate.
